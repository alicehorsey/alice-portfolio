    <section class="main-content">
        <p>Over the last ten years I have had an amazing time working in the live events and theatre
            industry. Starting out with Scottish Ballet as an Assistant Stage Manager in 2010, I moved to London to join
            the Stage Management team at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 2014 and
            then on to work on numerous more West End Musicals, touring internationally with the likes of "Ghost The
            Musical" and "Mamma Mia!". The photos below show a small snapshot of some of the productions I was a
            part of
            and it has been fun to use my new javscript and css skills on this site to showcase my previous work in
            visual way! Creative problem solving, analytical thinking, responding to changes to development of ideas,
            team working (pair-programming), working to a consistently high standard and just not giving up when
            something wasn't working was all part of my day to day work... it's fantastic to have found that coding uses
            so many of these transferable skills, I think it's the reason why I'm hooked!</p>
