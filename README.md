# Alice Horsey Portfolio Website

A portfolio website, showcasing a selction of my recent coding projects as well as information about me and my former career in the Theatre and Live Events industry.

The website has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for a bit of added functionality on the Live Events page.

The website is live at https://https://alicehorsey.github.io/ and I will continue to add to the project, updating coding projects in the coming weeks, so please do visit again soon!
